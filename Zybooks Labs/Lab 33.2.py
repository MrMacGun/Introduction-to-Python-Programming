#Complete a program that reads four values from input and stores the values in variables first_name, generic_location, whole_number, and plural_noun. 
#The program then uses the input values to output a short story. The first input statement is provided in the code as an example.


# Read a value from a user and store the value in first_name
first_name = input()
generic_location = input()
whole_number = int(input())
plural_noun = input()

# Output a short story using the four input values. Do not modify the code below.
print(first_name, 'went to', generic_location, 'to buy', whole_number, 'different types of', plural_noun)
