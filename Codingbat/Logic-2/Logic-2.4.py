#Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum
#However, if any of the values is a teen -- in the range 13..19 inclusive
#then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens.
#Write a separate helper "def fix_teen(n):"that takes in an int value and returns that value fixed for the teen rule.
#In this way, you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times (i.e. "decomposition"). 
#Define the helper below and at the same indent level as the main no_teen_sum().
